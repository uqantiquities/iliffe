Contested Histories Ipads

These two pages are ipad installations in support of the 2019-21 exhibition Contested Histories: Photographs from Mandate Palestine in the JH Iliffe Collection.

They provided opporunities for visitors to explore additional images from the JH Iliffe archive outside of the physical exhibition. 

The code was compiled from various online sources, principally W3C tutorials and code examples.
