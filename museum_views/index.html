<img alt="&lt;b&gt;JH Iliffe &lt;br&gt; Untitled (Pool of Central Court, Palestine Archaeological Museum), 1931-38 &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt; Digital Image from Black and White Photograph &lt;br&gt; Courtesy the Fryer Library, University of Queensland Library. UQFL 514 Box 4, Folder 1, Item 80
 &lt;br&gt; The pool in the Museum's central court included a fountain-head sculpted by Eric Gill. The inclusion of the pool at the centre of a colonnaded court echoes similar designs in Muslim architecture, such as the Court of the Myrtles at Alhambra, Spain, and shows Austen St Barbe Harrison's wide circle of influence when designing the Museum." class="w3-hover-opacity" onclick="onClick(this)" src="UQFL514_b4f1_080.jpg" style="width:100%" /> 
<img alt="&lt;b&gt;JH Iliffe &lt;br&gt; The biggest tree in Jerusalem, 1936-38 &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt; Digital Image from Black and White Photograph &lt;br&gt; Courtesy the Fryer Library, University of Queensland Library. UQFL 514 Box 4, Folder 3b, Item 65
 &lt;br&gt; The large pine tree in the grounds of the Museum was reportedly 250 years old when the museum was constructed. It survived until the mid 1990s. The tree was originally planned as the centrepiece for an additional courtyard to the west of the Museum which was never realised." class="w3-hover-opacity" onclick="onClick(this)" src="UQFL514_b4f3b_065.jpg" style="width:100%" />
<img alt="&lt;b&gt;Unknown Photographer &lt;br&gt; Untitled (South Gallery, Palestine Archaeological Museum), 1934-38 &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt; Digital Image from Black and White Photograph &lt;br&gt; Courtesy the Fryer Library, University of Queensland Library. UQFL 514 Box 1, Folder 4, Scrapbook, Page 13
 &lt;br&gt; This image of the Museum's South Gallery shows empty cases and local workers (one wearing a &lt;i&gt;tarbush&lt;/i&gt;) in the background working on finds. They are probably cataloging and preparing the displays for the Museum's opening in 1938. This is a rare photo from Iliffe's archive of people within the Museum environment." class="w3-hover-opacity" onclick="onClick(this)" src="UQFL514_0058.jpg" style="width:100%" />

 &lt;br&gt; The inscription above the door is blank in this early picture of a gallery in the Palestine Archaeological Museum. It is probably the North gallery (Iron Age, Roman, Byzantine) which was not complete when the Museum was opened in 1938." class="w3-hover-opacity" onclick="onClick(this)" src="UQFL514_0057.jpg" style="width:100%" />

 &lt;br&gt; This rarely seen angle of the Museum's Central Court shows its alignment, required by Rockefeller under the terms of his donation, between the Museum, the pre-existing pine tree and Qasr el-Sheikh Khalili, the summer residence of Muhammad al-Khalili, Mufti of Jerusalem in the late 17th century." class="w3-hover-opacity" onclick="onClick(this)" src="UQFL514_b4f1_055.jpg" style="width:100%" />

 &lt;br&gt; The Museum from Herod's Gate, with Mt Scopus (left) and the Mount of Olives (right) in the background. To the left of the Museum tower is the original building of the Hebrew University, and on the far right is the scaffolded tower of the Augusta Victoria Hospital. The three buildings recall the influence of foreign architects upon the rapidly developing built environment of Palestine in the early 20th century." class="w3-hover-opacity" onclick="onClick(this)" src="UQFL514_0045.jpg" style="width:100%" />
